*Vaunt Dark* and *Vakuari*
=================

This repository contains a pair of custom stylesheets I've been working on for use with FurAffinity.
For Firefox and other Gecko engined browsers, this usually requires the installation of Stylish.
For Chrome and other Blink/Webkit engined browsers, you have the choice of Stylish, 
or letting the browser handle it natively.
I apologize in advance on non-Gecko browsers: 
There seems to always be a brief flash of the default page style before my (or any other) work takes over.
